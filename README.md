### For lack of a better name.
Application for managing and updating PaperMC servers.

*Currently only planning releases for Unix based platforms (Linux & MacOS). Considering most VPS services utilize Unix this is the natural choice. However, if demand for a Windows version is high, I will work on a Windows release.*

### Planned Features
* Handling of server functions using console commands.

## Required Python Packages
* requests (dependencies below) 
  * certifi
  * chardet
  * idna
  * urllib3
