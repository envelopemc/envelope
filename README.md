Application for managing and updating PaperMC servers.

~~*Currently only planning releases for Unix based platforms (Linux & MacOS). Considering most VPS services utilize Unix-like operating systems, this is the natural choice. However, if demand for a Windows version is high, I will work on a Windows release.*~~

*Creating a Windows version along size the Unix version is easier and makes more sense. So, unless otherwise noted, this will work for both platforms.*


## Required Python Packages
* requests

## Planned Features
* Handling of server functions using console commands.
* Web UI for managing server remotely.
* Automatic version control for PaperMC
