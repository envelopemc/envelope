Application for managing and updating PaperMC servers.

*Currently only planning releases for Unix based platforms (Linux & MacOS). Considering most VPS services utilize Unix-like operating systems, this is the natural choice. However, if demand for a Windows version is high, I will work on a Windows release.*


## Required Python Packages
* requests

## Planned Features
* Web UI for managing server remotely.
* Automatic version control for PaperMC
